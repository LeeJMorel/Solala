README

Solala was originally a desk pet robot! Similar to Vector in function, it runs off AI image visualization, microphones, and interactive design. Unfortunately we haven't yet found anyone available for hardware development, so for now we are building just the app portion, which can be used on its own. Unlike Vector, Solala's goals aren't to just be a cute little guy at your desk. Solala is specifically a mental health management tool, designed to help develop emotional intelligence skills, track moods and stress levels, and encourage valuable tools to maintain work/life balance and prevent burn out. They are sort of like a personal assistant for your desk. Solala looks like a plant because they are here for your personal growth!
